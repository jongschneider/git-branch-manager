# Mergeback Branch Creation Fix - Progress Report

## What We've Done

### ✅ Core Issue Fixed
**Original Problem**: Mergeback branch/worktree naming was using source branch instead of target branch
- Example: `MERGE_INGSVC-5638_production` (wrong) vs `MERGE_INGSVC-5638_master` (correct)

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Completely rewrote mergeback logic using proper tree structure from `docs/worktree_nodes.md`
- Created `internal/worktree_tree.go` with full tree implementation
- Embedded `WorktreeManager` in `GBMConfig` with auto-initialization in `ParseGBMConfig`

### ✅ Tree Structure Implementation
**Files Created/Modified**:
- `internal/worktree_tree.go` - Complete tree implementation with all methods from docs
- `internal/worktree_tree_test.go` - Comprehensive test suite (11 test functions, all passing)
- `internal/config.go` - Added `Tree *WorktreeManager` field to `GBMConfig`
- `cmd/mergeback.go` - Rewrote `findMergeTargetBranchAndWorktree` to use tree logic

**Key Features**:
- Tree construction from YAML config (`merge_into` uses worktree names, not branch names)
- Full traversal methods (WalkUp, WalkDown, GetPath, GetDepth)
- Leaf node identification (GetLeafNodes, GetDeepestLeafNodes)
- Multiple root node support (critical fix)

### ✅ Critical Bug Fix - Multiple Root Nodes
**Problem**: Original implementation threw "multiple root nodes found" error
**Impact**: Broke sync tests like `TestSyncCommand_UntrackedWorktrees`
**Solution**: 
- Changed `WorktreeManager.root` to `WorktreeManager.roots []`
- Added `GetRoots()` method, kept `GetRoot()` for backward compatibility
- Added `GetAllDeepestLeafNodes()` to traverse all trees
- Updated mergeback logic to work across multiple trees

### ✅ Test Coverage
**Tests Added**:
- `cmd/mergeback_tree_test.go` - Mergeback-specific tests
- `TestMergebackNamingProductionToMaster` - **PASSES** ✅ (core issue verified fixed)
- Multiple root node tests - All passing

**Key Test Results**:
- ✅ `TestMergebackNamingProductionToMaster` passes - confirms fix works
- ✅ `TestSyncCommand_UntrackedWorktrees` now passes - multiple roots fixed
- ✅ All worktree tree tests pass

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Correctly
- **Simple production → master mergebacks**: Creates `MERGE_INGSVC-5638_master` ✅
- **Multiple root node support**: No longer blocks sync operations ✅
- **Tree structure parsing**: Handles complex branch hierarchies ✅
- **Git log logic**: Uses `git log origin/<target>..origin/<source> --oneline` with fallback ✅

### ❌ Known Issue
**Test**: `TestMergebackNamingWithTreeStructure` fails
- **Problem**: 3-level chain (production → preview → master) returns "master" instead of "preview"
- **Expected**: production → preview should create `MERGE_*_preview`
- **Actual**: Returns `MERGE_*_master` (skips intermediate step)

**Root Cause**: The `hasCommitsBetweenBranches` function works correctly, but:
1. Production has commits that preview doesn't → should trigger production → preview
2. But algorithm might be finding no commits between preview → master
3. Falls back to recursive logic and ends up at master (final target)

## Where to Pick Up Next

### Priority 1: Fix 3-Level Chain Logic
**Investigation Needed**:
1. Debug why `hasCommitsBetweenBranches(preview, production)` isn't triggering the production → preview step
2. Check if test setup creates proper commit history (commits only on production, preview/master identical)
3. Consider if algorithm should prioritize first step vs. final destination

**Files to Focus On**:
- `cmd/mergeback.go:177-193` - `hasCommitsBetweenBranches` function
- `cmd/mergeback.go:195-213` - `findNextMergeTargetInChain` recursive logic
- `cmd/mergeback_tree_test.go:140-205` - Fix or understand test expectations

### Priority 2: Algorithm Refinement
**Questions to Answer**:
1. Should mergeback prioritize immediate next step or final destination?
2. How should it handle cases where multiple steps need merging?
3. Should it return multiple merge targets for batch processing?

### Priority 3: Test Suite Completion
**Remaining Work**:
- Fix the 3-level chain test or adjust expectations
- Add edge case tests (empty repos, circular references, etc.)
- User testing checkbox: `[ ] User test: Run mergeback command and verify branch/worktree names use target branch`

## Key Implementation Details

### Tree Structure Rules
- `merge_into` field contains **worktree names**, not branch names
- Multiple root nodes are allowed and expected
- Tree traversal starts from deepest leaves (production branches)

### Git Log Logic
```bash
git log origin/<target>..origin/<source> --oneline
# Falls back to: git log <target>..<source> --oneline
```

### Critical Files
- `internal/worktree_tree.go` - Core tree implementation 
- `internal/config.go:82` - `Tree *WorktreeManager` embedded in `GBMConfig`
- `cmd/mergeback.go:148` - Uses `GetAllDeepestLeafNodes()`
- `cmd/mergeback_tree_test.go` - Integration tests

## Success Metrics
- ✅ Original issue (production → master naming) is **FIXED**
- ✅ Blocking sync test failures are **RESOLVED** 
- ✅ Tree structure implementation is **COMPLETE**
- ❌ 3-level chain test needs **INVESTIGATION**

## Task Status
- Todo item: "fix mergeback branch creation" - **90% COMPLETE**
- Remaining: Fix 3-level chain edge case and final user testing
