Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can now provide you with a comprehensive understanding of the mergeback checking functionality and identify the potential issue. Let me summarize my findings:

## Analysis of Git Branch Manager (gbm) Mergeback Checking Logic

### 1. **Where mergeback checking logic is implemented:**

**Primary Files:**
- **`/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/mergeback.go`** - Contains the core `CheckMergeBackStatus()` function
- **`/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/root.go`** - Contains the triggering logic in `checkAndDisplayMergeBackAlerts()`
- **`/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/mergeback.go`** - Contains the mergeback command implementation

### 2. **How the system detects when mergebacks are needed:**

The system uses the `CheckMergeBackStatus()` function (lines 37-129 in `internal/mergeback.go`) which:

1. **Parses the configuration** from `gbm.branchconfig.yaml`
2. **Iterates through each worktree** that has a `merge_into` target (line 78)
3. **Checks if both branches exist** using `gitManager.BranchExists()` (lines 90-94)
4. **Gets commits that need merging** using `getCommitsNeedingMergeBack()` (lines 96-100)
5. **Identifies user commits** to determine alert urgency (lines 106-114)

### 3. **Configuration parsing for merge_into relationships:**

The configuration parsing is handled in:
- **`/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/config.go`** - Lines 79-88 define the `GBMConfig` and `WorktreeConfig` structs
- **`ParseGBMConfig()` function** (lines 176-189) reads the YAML configuration

**Configuration Structure:**
```yaml
worktrees:
  master:
    branch: master
    description: "Main production branch"
  production:
    branch: production-2025-07-1
    description: "Blade Runner"
    merge_into: master
```

### 4. **Code that uses last_mergeback_check from state.toml:**

The `last_mergeback_check` is handled in:
- **`/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/state.go`** - Line 29 defines `LastMergebackCheck time.Time`
- **`/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/root.go`** - Functions:
  - `updateLastMergebackCheck()` (lines 227-251) - Updates the timestamp after showing alerts
  - `shouldShowMergeBackAlerts()` (lines 281-340) - Checks if enough time has passed since last check

### 5. **Flow of how branch changes trigger mergeback detection:**

The flow is triggered in the `PersistentPreRun` of the root command (line 30 in `cmd/root.go`):

1. **`checkAndDisplayMergeBackAlerts()`** is called on every command execution
2. **`shouldShowMergeBackAlerts()`** checks:
   - If merge back alerts are enabled in config
   - If enough time has passed since `last_mergeback_check`
   - Uses different intervals based on whether user has commits needing mergeback
3. **`CheckMergeBackStatus()`** analyzes the git history using:
   - `getCommitsNeedingMergeBack()` which uses `git log targetBranch..sourceBranch`
4. **`FormatMergeBackAlert()`** formats the alert if mergebacks are needed

### 6. **Potential Issue Identified:**

Looking at your specific case, the issue might be in the **`getCommitsNeedingMergeBack()` function** (lines 166-206 in `internal/mergeback.go`). This function uses:

```go
git log targetBranch..sourceBranch --format=%H|%s|%an|%ae|%ct
```

**Potential Problems:**
1. **Branch name resolution**: The function uses `worktreeConfig.Branch` directly, which in your case is `production-2025-07-1`, but it might not be resolving to the correct remote branch `origin/production-2025-07-1`
2. **Remote branch tracking**: The system might not be checking the remote branches properly
3. **Merge commit detection**: If the hotfix was merged via a merge commit, the system might not be detecting the relationship correctly

### 7. **Key Functions to Debug:**

1. **`CheckMergeBackStatus()`** - Main entry point
2. **`getCommitsNeedingMergeBack()`** - Git command execution
3. **`parseConfigFile()`** - Configuration parsing
4. **`shouldShowMergeBackAlerts()`** - Timing logic

### 8. **Recommendations for Debugging:**

1. **Check if branches exist**: Verify that `gitManager.BranchExists()` returns true for both `master` and `production-2025-07-1`
2. **Test git command manually**: Run `git log master..production-2025-07-1` in the repository to see if it returns commits
3. **Check remote tracking**: The system might need to check `origin/production-2025-07-1` instead of `production-2025-07-1`
4. **Verify configuration loading**: Ensure the `gbm.branchconfig.yaml` is being read correctly

The most likely issue is that the system is looking for a local branch `production-2025-07-1` but the commits are on `origin/production-2025-07-1`, causing the mergeback detection to fail.

## Investigation Results

Based on my investigation of the git repository state in the `scratch_email_ingester` tmux session, here are the key findings:

### 1. Repository Structure
- **Main repository**: `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/email_ingester`
- **Tmux session**: `scratch_email_ingester` with worktrees in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/email_ingester/worktrees/`
- **Current worktrees**: `HOTFIX_INGSVC-5638` and `master`

### 2. Configuration Files
- **`.gbm/state.toml`**: Shows the hotfix worktree `INGSVC-5638` is based on `production-2025-07-1`
- **`gbm.branchconfig.yaml`**: Defines that `production` worktree uses branch `production-2025-07-1` and merges into `master`

### 3. Branch Status Analysis
The issue is **branch synchronization**:

- **Local branch `production-2025-07-1`**:
  - Latest commit: `19d2bc0` (Merged in hotfix/INGSVC-5635__truncated_email)
  - Missing the hotfix merge commit `612a01b`

- **Remote branch `origin/production-2025-07-1`**:
  - Latest commit: `612a01b` (Merged in hotfix/INGSVC-5638_EMAIL_Invalid_Date_7_16_2025_13_00_00)
  - Contains the hotfix that was merged

### 4. Key Git Commands Results
- `git log master..production-2025-07-1 --oneline`: **No output** (local branch has no commits ahead of master)
- `git log master..origin/production-2025-07-1 --oneline`: **Shows 2 commits** (the hotfix merge and the individual commit)

### 5. Root Cause
The mergeback detection is failing because:
1. The **local** `production-2025-07-1` branch is **out of date** 
2. The mergeback logic checks the **local** branch (`production-2025-07-1`) instead of the **remote** branch (`origin/production-2025-07-1`)
3. Since the local branch doesn't have the merged hotfix commits, the `git log master..production-2025-07-1` command returns no results
4. The system should be checking `git log master..origin/production-2025-07-1` to detect commits that need to be merged back

### 6. Solution Required
The mergeback detection logic needs to be updated to:
1. **Check remote branches** (e.g., `origin/production-2025-07-1`) instead of local branches
2. **Fetch latest remote state** before checking for mergeback requirements
3. **Consider using `origin/` prefix** when determining if commits exist that need merging back to master

### 7. Manual Test Results
When I ran `gbm mergeback` manually, it **did work** and detected the hotfix activity, but this was likely due to the recent commit detection logic finding the hotfix in the git log, not the branch comparison logic.

The fix should be in the worktree-manager codebase to ensure branch reference resolution checks remote branches when determining mergeback requirements.
