# Analysis for worktreeRemover Interface Implementation

## Analysis of cmd/remove.go Implementation

Based on my comprehensive analysis of the `cmd/remove.go` file and the surrounding codebase, here's a detailed analysis:

### Current Implementation Overview

The `remove.go` file implements a Cobra command for removing worktrees with the following structure:

- **Main function**: `newRemoveCommand()` - creates and configures the cobra command
- **Arguments**: Takes exactly one argument (worktree name)
- **Flags**: Supports a `--force` flag to bypass safety checks and confirmation prompts

### Functions Currently Implemented

The file contains:

1. **`newRemoveCommand()`** - Command factory function that:
   - Defines command metadata (Use, Short, Long descriptions)
   - Sets up argument validation (`cobra.ExactArgs(1)`)
   - Implements the main command execution logic in `RunE`
   - Adds the `--force` flag configuration
   - Implements shell completion for worktree names via `ValidArgsFunction`

### Manager Methods Used

The remove command uses the following Manager methods:

1. **`GetWorktreePath(worktreeName string)`** - Validates worktree existence and gets path
2. **`GetWorktreeStatus(worktreePath string)`** - Checks for uncommitted changes 
3. **`RemoveWorktree(worktreeName string)`** - Performs the actual worktree removal
4. **`GetAllWorktrees()`** - Used for shell completion to list available worktrees

### Structure and Flow

The command execution follows this flow:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Parse `--force` flag
   - Extract worktree name from args
   - Create manager via `createInitializedManager()`
   - Handle `ErrLoadGBMConfig` gracefully with verbose logging

2. **Validation**:
   - Check if worktree exists using `GetWorktreePath()`
   - If not using `--force`, check for uncommitted changes via `GetWorktreeStatus()`
   - Return error if uncommitted changes exist without force

3. **Confirmation** (unless `--force` is used):
   - Prompt user with "Are you sure?" message
   - Accept "y" or "yes" (case-insensitive) to proceed
   - Cancel operation for any other input

4. **Removal**:
   - Call `manager.RemoveWorktree(worktreeName)`
   - Display success message

5. **Shell Completion**:
   - `ValidArgsFunction` provides auto-completion by listing all available worktrees
   - Handles manager initialization errors gracefully

### Proposed `worktreeRemover` Interface

Based on the analysis, the `worktreeRemover` interface should abstract these Manager methods:

```go
//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreeRemover.go . worktreeRemover

// worktreeRemover interface abstracts the Manager operations needed for removing worktrees
type worktreeRemover interface {
    GetWorktreePath(worktreeName string) (string, error)
    GetWorktreeStatus(worktreePath string) (*internal.GitStatus, error)  
    RemoveWorktree(worktreeName string) error
    GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*internal.WorktreeListInfo, error)
}
```

## Analysis of Interface Patterns in the Worktree Manager Codebase

### Interface Structure and Naming

**Interface Naming Convention:**
- Interfaces follow the pattern: `worktree<Operation>` (e.g., `worktreePuller`, `worktreePusher`, `worktreeAdder`)
- All interfaces are defined in the command files where they're used (`cmd/pull.go`, `cmd/push.go`, `cmd/add.go`)
- Interfaces are **not exported** (lowercase names) as they are internal abstractions for testing

**Interface Method Patterns:**
- Common methods across interfaces:
  - `IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)` - Check if currently in a worktree
  - `GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*internal.WorktreeListInfo, error)` - Get all worktrees
  - Operation-specific methods:
    - `PullWorktree(worktreeName string) error` / `PullAllWorktrees() error`
    - `PushWorktree(worktreeName string) error` / `PushAllWorktrees() error`
    - `AddWorktree(worktreeName, branchName string, newBranch bool, baseBranch string) error`

### Mock Generation Patterns

**Mock Generation Setup:**
- Uses `//go:generate` directives with `go tool moq` or `github.com/matryer/moq`
- Two different command formats found:
  - Pull: `//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreePuller.go . worktreePuller`
  - Push: `//go:generate go run github.com/matryer/moq@latest -out ./autogen_worktreePusher.go . worktreePusher`
  - Add: `//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreeAdder.go . worktreeAdder`

### Command Function Refactoring

**Separation of Concerns:**
- Command execution logic moved to separate handler functions:
  - `handlePullAll(puller worktreePuller) error`
  - `handlePullCurrent(puller worktreePuller, currentPath string) error`
  - `handlePullNamed(puller worktreePuller, worktreeName string) error`
- Main command function (`RunE`) orchestrates:
  1. Parse flags and arguments
  2. Get working directory
  3. Create and initialize manager
  4. Route to appropriate handler function

**Interface Injection:**
- Manager satisfies interfaces through method implementation
- Commands accept interface types rather than concrete `Manager`
- Enables easy mocking for unit tests

### Test Patterns with Mocks

**Unit Test Structure:**
- Tests are organized into table-driven test suites
- Each test case includes:
  - `name`: descriptive test case name
  - `mockSetup` or `setupMock`: function returning configured mock
  - `expectErr`: function to verify error conditions
  - Optional setup parameters (like `currentPath`, `worktreeName`)

**Mock Usage Patterns:**
```go
mock := &worktreePullerMock{
    IsInWorktreeFunc: func(currentPath string) (bool, string, error) {
        return true, "dev", nil
    },
    PullWorktreeFunc: func(worktreeName string) error {
        assert.Equal(t, "dev", worktreeName)
        return nil
    },
}
```

### Integration Test Patterns

**Location and Organization:**
- Integration tests moved to `internal/` package (e.g., `internal/pull_test.go`, `internal/push_test.go`)
- Test real git operations against actual repositories
- Use `testutils.GitTestRepo` for test repository setup

This analysis shows a well-structured approach to interface design that prioritizes testability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns. The pattern is consistent across pull, push, and add operations, making it easy to follow the same approach for the remove operation.
