# debug mergeback checking
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 47368

## Original Todo
- debug mergeback checking
    * I merged a hotfix to origin/production-2025-07-1
    ```yaml
# .gbm.branchconfig.yaml
# Git Branch Manager Configuration

# Worktree definitions - key is the worktree name, value defines the branch and merge strategy
worktrees:
  # Primary worktree - no merge_into (root of merge chain)
  master:
    branch: master
    description: "Main production branch"
  production:
    branch: production-2025-07-1
    description: "Blade Runner"
    merge_into: master
```
    * this should mean that a mergeback to master is required.
    ```toml
# .gbm/state.toml
last_sync = 2025-07-17T09:08:23.516692-04:00
tracked_vars = ["master", "production"]
ad_hoc_worktrees = ["HOTFIX_INGSVC-5638"]
current_worktree = "master"
previous_worktree = "production"
last_mergeback_check = 0001-01-01T00:00:00Z
```
    * the project in question is in the tmux session `scratch_email_ingester`. feel free to check it out to debug. just don't push to origin!

## Description
The mergeback checking functionality is failing to detect when commits merged to remote branches (like `origin/production-2025-07-1`) need to be merged back to master. The issue is that the system only checks local branches, but when hotfixes are merged directly to remote branches, the local branch remains out of date. This causes the `git log master..production-2025-07-1` command to return no results, even though `git log master..origin/production-2025-07-1` shows commits that need merging back.

## Implementation Plan
The fix requires updating the mergeback checking logic to check remote branches instead of local branches when determining if commits need to be merged back:

- [x] Update `getCommitsNeedingMergeBack()` in `internal/mergeback.go` to check remote branches (e.g., `origin/production-2025-07-1`) instead of local branches
- [x] Add remote branch resolution logic to prefix configured branches with `origin/` when they exist remotely but not locally
- [x] Update `BranchExists()` checks in `CheckMergeBackStatus()` to also check for remote branch existence
- [x] Add a git fetch operation before mergeback checking to ensure remote branch state is up-to-date
- [x] Create automated test that verifies mergeback detection works with remote-only branch changes
- [x] User test: Verify the fix works with the actual `scratch_email_ingester` repository scenario
- [x] Add proper error handling for missing remote branches to alert users about configuration issues
- [x] Create Remote() utility function for consistent remote branch name formatting

## Notes
Successfully implemented remote branch resolution for mergeback checking:

1. **Added BranchExistsLocalOrRemote() method** to GitManager to check both local and remote branches
2. **Updated getCommitsNeedingMergeBack()** to use remote branches directly:
   - Fetches latest remote state
   - Uses `origin/{branchName}` for mergeback detection
   - Returns clear error message if remote branch doesn't exist, indicating configuration issue
3. **Added comprehensive tests** to verify remote branch resolution works correctly
4. **Created Remote() utility function** for consistent remote branch formatting across codebase
5. **Verified fix works with the original issue scenario**:
   - Hotfix merged to origin/production-2025-07-1
   - Local production branch behind remote
   - System correctly detects mergeback needed from production to master

The core issue was that mergeback detection only checked local branches, but when hotfixes are merged directly to remote branches, local branches remain out of date. The fix directly uses remote branches (origin/{branchName}) for mergeback detection, which is simpler and more accurate since we only care about what commits exist on the remote branches that need merging back.
