Great! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the current implementation. Based on my analysis, here's a detailed report:

## Analysis of cmd/push.go and Related Files

### Current Implementation Status

**Good news**: The worktreePusher interface extraction has **already been completed**! Here's what I found:

### 1. Functions in cmd/push.go and Their Signatures

The cmd/push.go file contains:

- **`newPushCommand() *cobra.Command`** - Creates the push command with flags and argument handling
- **`handlePushAll(pusher worktreePusher) error`** - Handles `gbm push --all` operation
- **`handlePushCurrent(pusher worktreePusher, currentPath string) error`** - Handles `gbm push` (current worktree)
- **`handlePushNamed(pusher worktreePusher, worktreeName string) error`** - Handles `gbm push <name>` (specific worktree)

### 2. worktreePusher Interface (Already Exists!)

The interface is already defined in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/push.go` lines 16-21:

```go
type worktreePusher interface {
	PushAllWorktrees() error
	PushWorktree(worktreeName string) error
	IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)
	GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*internal.WorktreeListInfo, error)
}
```

### 3. Manager Struct Methods Used by Push Functions

The Manager struct (in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go`) implements the worktreePusher interface with these methods:

- **`PushWorktree(worktreeName string) error`** (line 654-657)
  - Constructs worktree path using `filepath.Join(m.repoPath, m.config.Settings.WorktreePrefix, worktreeName)`
  - Delegates to `m.gitManager.PushWorktree(worktreePath)`

- **`PushAllWorktrees() error`** (line 668-684)
  - Gets all worktrees using `m.GetAllWorktrees()`
  - Iterates through each worktree and calls `m.gitManager.PushWorktree(info.Path)`
  - Provides progress reporting with success/failure messages
  - Continues on failure (doesn't abort on first error)

- **`IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)`** (line 664-666)
  - Delegates to `m.gitManager.IsInWorktree(currentPath)`

- **`GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*internal.WorktreeListInfo, error)`**
  - Returns map of worktree names to their metadata

### 4. Underlying GitManager.PushWorktree Implementation

The actual git push logic is in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/git.go` lines 1003+:

- Validates worktree path exists
- Gets current branch using `GetCurrentBranchInPath()`
- Checks if upstream is set using `GetUpstreamBranch()`
- If no upstream: uses `git push -u origin <branch>`
- If upstream exists: uses simple `git push`
- Executes command in the worktree directory

### 5. Dependencies and Imports

cmd/push.go imports:
- `"errors"`, `"fmt"`, `"os"` - Standard library
- `"gbm/internal"` - Internal package types
- `"github.com/spf13/cobra"` - CLI framework

### 6. Mock Generation and Testing

**Already implemented**:
- Mock generation directive: `//go:generate go run github.com/matryer/moq@latest -out ./autogen_worktreePusher.go . worktreePusher`
- Generated mock file: `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/autogen_worktreePusher.go`
- Comprehensive unit tests: `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/push_test.go`
- Integration tests: `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/push_test.go`

### 7. Comparison with pull.go Pattern

The push implementation **perfectly follows the same pattern** as pull.go:

| Aspect | pull.go | push.go | Status |
|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Interface definition | ✅ worktreePuller | ✅ worktreePusher | ✅ Identical pattern |
| Mock generation | ✅ moq directive | ✅ moq directive | ✅ Identical pattern |
| Handler functions | ✅ 3 handlers | ✅ 3 handlers | ✅ Identical pattern |
| Interface methods | ✅ 4 methods | ✅ 4 methods | ✅ Identical pattern |
| Unit tests | ✅ Comprehensive | ✅ Comprehensive | ✅ Identical pattern |
| Integration tests | ✅ internal/pull_test.go | ✅ internal/push_test.go | ✅ Identical pattern |

### 8. Testing Structure Analysis

**Unit Tests** (`cmd/push_test.go`):
- Uses `worktreePusherMock` for fast, isolated testing
- Tests all handler functions: `handlePushAll`, `handlePushCurrent`, `handlePushNamed`
- Covers success and error scenarios
- Validates mock calls and error messages
- Follows table-driven test pattern

**Integration Tests** (`internal/push_test.go`):
- Uses real git repositories with `testutils.GitTestRepo`
- Tests actual `Manager.PushWorktree()` and `Manager.PushAllWorktrees()` methods
- Includes upstream setup, push operations, and error cases
- Provides comprehensive coverage of real git operations

## Conclusion

**The worktreePusher interface extraction is already complete and fully implemented!** The current implementation:

1. ✅ **Interface extracted**: `worktreePusher` interface with 4 methods
2. ✅ **Mock generation**: Auto-generated mocks with moq
3. ✅ **Handler refactoring**: All functions use the interface
4. ✅ **Unit tests**: Comprehensive mock-based testing
5. ✅ **Integration tests**: Real git repository testing
6. ✅ **Follows patterns**: Identical structure to pull.go implementation

The implementation is **production-ready** and follows Go best practices for interface-driven design, dependency injection, and comprehensive testing. No further work is needed on the interface extraction - the task has already been completed successfully.
