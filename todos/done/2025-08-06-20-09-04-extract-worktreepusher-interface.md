# Extract worktreePusher interface for cmd/push.go
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 23482

## Original Todo
- [ ] **Extract worktreePusher interface for cmd/push.go**
  - Create interface with: PushAllWorktrees(), PushWorktree(), IsInWorktree(), GetAllWorktrees()
  - Add mock generation: `//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreePusher.go . worktreePusher`
  - Refactor command functions to use interface
  - Write unit tests with mocks

## Description
This task was to extract a worktreePusher interface for cmd/push.go to enable better unit testing by allowing dependency injection and mocking. However, the analysis shows this work has already been completed with a production-ready implementation that includes:

- ✅ worktreePusher interface with 4 methods (PushAllWorktrees, PushWorktree, IsInWorktree, GetAllWorktrees)  
- ✅ Mock generation using moq
- ✅ Refactored command functions using the interface
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests with mocks
- ✅ Integration tests in the internal package

## Implementation Plan
Since the worktreePusher interface extraction is already complete, this task involves:

- [x] Verify the existing implementation is correct and follows patterns
- [x] Confirm all tests are passing and provide good coverage
- [x] Update todos.md to mark this task as completed
- [x] Document the completion in the project

## Notes
The implementation is already production-ready and follows Go best practices for interface-driven design, dependency injection, and comprehensive testing.

## Completion Documentation
This task was found to be already completed when investigated. The worktreePusher interface extraction was implemented with:

1. **Interface Definition**: `worktreePusher` interface in cmd/push.go:16-21 with 4 methods:
   - `PushAllWorktrees() error`
   - `PushWorktree(worktreeName string) error` 
   - `IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)`
   - `GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*internal.WorktreeListInfo, error)`

2. **Mock Generation**: Auto-generated mocks using moq with directive on line 15
   - Generated file: `cmd/autogen_worktreePusher.go`

3. **Refactored Functions**: All handler functions use the interface:
   - `handlePushAll(pusher worktreePusher) error`
   - `handlePushCurrent(pusher worktreePusher, currentPath string) error`
   - `handlePushNamed(pusher worktreePusher, worktreeName string) error`

4. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Unit tests in `cmd/push_test.go` with mock-based testing
   - Integration tests in `internal/push_test.go` with real git operations
   - All tests passing with good coverage

The implementation follows the exact same pattern established by the worktreePuller interface and is production-ready.
