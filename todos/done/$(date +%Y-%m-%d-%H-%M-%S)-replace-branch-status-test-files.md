# Replace duplicate branch status calls in test files with new utilities
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 28640

## Original Todo
**Replace duplicate branch status calls in test files with new utilities**
- Update `cmd/sync_test.go:210,403,410,875,882`
- Test: All sync tests pass

## Description
Replace direct git command executions in test files with existing GitManager utility functions for better consistency, error handling, and maintainability. Focus on branch status queries, upstream checks, and commit hash retrievals in sync_test.go, push_test.go, and pull_test.go.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Replace branch status calls in cmd/sync_test.go (lines 210, 403, 410, 875, 882) with GetCurrentBranchInPath
- [x] Replace upstream check in cmd/push_test.go (line 96) with GetUpstreamBranch
- [x] Replace commit hash retrieval in cmd/push_test.go (line 79) with GetCommitHashInPath
- [x] Replace commit hash retrieval in cmd/pull_test.go (line 46) with GetCommitHashInPath
- [x] Run tests to verify all sync, push, and pull tests still pass
- [x] Run validation to ensure no regressions

## Notes

**Successfully Completed:**
- Replaced 5 branch status calls in sync_test.go with GetCurrentBranchInPath utility 
- Replaced upstream check in push_test.go with GetUpstreamBranch utility
- Fixed push_test.go: Reverted getRemoteCommitHash to use direct git command (operates in raw repo context)
- Replaced commit hash retrieval in pull_test.go with GetCommitHashInPath utility
- Cleaned up unused imports (os/exec, strings) from pull_test.go
- All validation checks pass (format, vet, lint, build)
- Push tests now pass (TestPushCommand_CurrentWorktree, TestPushCommand_AllWorktrees verified)

**Total Replacements:** 6 direct git command calls replaced with utility functions
**Context-Aware Decision:** Kept getRemoteCommitHash as direct git command due to raw repository context

**Benefits:**
- Consistent error handling across all test git operations
- Better maintainability using centralized utility functions  
- Improved code clarity with cleaner function signatures
- No behavioral changes - same functionality with better structure
