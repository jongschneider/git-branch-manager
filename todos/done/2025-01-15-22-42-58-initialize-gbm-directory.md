# Initialize .gbm directory with default config.toml and state.toml files on `gbm clone`
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 55878

## Original Todo
- initialize .gbm directory with default config.toml and state.toml files on `gbm clone`

## Description
Modify the `gbm clone` command to explicitly initialize the `.gbm` directory with default `config.toml` and `state.toml` files during the cloning process. Currently, these files are only created lazily when first saved, but they should be created immediately during clone to provide a complete setup.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Modify `initializeWorktreeManagement()` function in cmd/clone.go:255-285 to call `manager.SaveConfig()` and `manager.SaveState()` after manager creation
- [x] Add proper error handling for the save operations with descriptive error messages
- [x] Update existing tests in cmd/clone_test.go to validate .gbm directory and files are created during clone operation
- [x] User test: Clone a new repository and verify .gbm/config.toml and .gbm/state.toml exist with default content

## Notes
Implementation leverages existing SaveConfig() and SaveState() methods which already handle directory creation and file writing with proper error handling.
