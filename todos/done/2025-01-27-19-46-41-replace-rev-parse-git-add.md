# Replace duplicate rev-parse calls in internal/git_add.go with new utilities
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 52831

## Original Todo
**Replace duplicate rev-parse calls in internal/git_add.go with new utilities**
- Update lines 48, 54, 89 to use new utilities
- Test: `gbm add` command still works correctly

## Description
This todo appears to be already completed. The internal/git_add.go file at lines 48, 54, and 89 is already using centralized Git utilities (GetCommitHash, VerifyRef) instead of direct rev-parse calls. No changes are needed.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Verify the current state of internal/git_add.go lines 48, 54, 89 and surrounding context
- [x] Confirm that existing centralized utilities are already being used correctly
- [x] Check if there are any remaining direct git rev-parse calls in internal/git_add.go that need replacement
- [x] Update the todo list to reflect the actual current state
- [x] Automated test: Run `go test ./internal` to ensure git_add functionality tests pass
- [x] User test: Run `gbm add` command to verify it works correctly
