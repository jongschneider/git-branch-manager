Based on my analysis of the Go codebase, I found exactly where the mergeback branch creation is implemented. Here are the specific file paths, line numbers, and code snippets:

## Mergeback Branch Creation Implementation

### 1. Main Mergeback Branch Generation Function
**File:** `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/mergeback.go`
**Lines:** 232-237

```go
// generateMergebackBranchName creates a mergeback branch name with proper formatting
// Now includes target branch suffix to prevent conflicts: merge/PROJECT-123_fix_preview
var generateMergebackBranchName = func(worktreeName, jiraTicket, targetWorktree string, manager *internal.Manager) (string, error) {
	generator := createBranchNameGenerator("merge")
	return generator(worktreeName, jiraTicket, strings.ToLower(targetWorktree), manager)
}
```

### 2. Unified Branch Name Generator Function
**File:** `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/helpers.go`
**Lines:** 10-68

This is the core function that creates branch names with the "merge/" prefix:

```go
// createBranchNameGenerator creates a function that generates branch names with the specified prefix
func createBranchNameGenerator(prefix string) func(worktreeName, jiraTicket, targetSuffix string, manager *internal.Manager) (string, error) {
	return func(worktreeName, jiraTicket, targetSuffix string, manager *internal.Manager) (string, error) {
		var branchName string

		if jiraTicket != "" && internal.IsJiraKey(jiraTicket) {
			// Generate branch name from JIRA ticket
			if manager != nil {
				jiraBranchName, err := internal.GenerateBranchFromJira(jiraTicket, manager)
				if err != nil {
					// Fallback to simple format
					if targetSuffix != "" {
						branchName = fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s_%s", prefix, strings.ToUpper(jiraTicket), targetSuffix)
					} else {
						branchName = fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", prefix, strings.ToUpper(jiraTicket))
					}
				} else {
					// Replace any prefix with the specified prefix
					parts := strings.Split(jiraBranchName, "/")
					if len(parts) > 1 {
						parts[0] = prefix
						baseName := strings.Join(parts, "/")
						if targetSuffix != "" {
							branchName = fmt.Sprintf("%s_%s", baseName, targetSuffix)
						} else {
							branchName = baseName
						}
					}
				}
			}
		} else {
			// Generate from worktree name
			cleanName := strings.ReplaceAll(worktreeName, " ", "-")
			cleanName = strings.ReplaceAll(cleanName, "_", "-")
			cleanName = strings.ToLower(cleanName)
			if targetSuffix != "" {
				branchName = fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s_%s", prefix, cleanName, targetSuffix)
			} else {
				branchName = fmt.Sprintf("%s/%s", prefix, cleanName)
			}
		}

		return branchName, nil
	}
}
```

### 3. Mergeback Worktree Name Generation with "MERGE_" Prefix
**File:** `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/mergeback.go`
**Lines:** 83-91

```go
// Get mergeback prefix from config and build worktree name
mergebackPrefix := manager.GetConfig().Settings.MergebackPrefix
var mergebackWorktreeName string
if mergebackPrefix != "" {
	mergebackWorktreeName = mergebackPrefix + "_" + worktreeName + "_" + baseWorktreeName
} else {
	mergebackWorktreeName = worktreeName + "_" + baseWorktreeName
}
```

### 4. Default "MERGE_" Prefix Configuration
**File:** `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/config.go`
**Lines:** 35, 98

```go
// In Settings struct
MergebackPrefix              string        `toml:"mergeback_prefix"`

// Default value
MergebackPrefix:             "MERGE",               // Default mergeback prefix
```

### 5. Usage in the Mergeback Command
**File:** `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/mergeback.go`
**Line:** 78

```go
branchName, err := generateMergebackBranchName(worktreeName, jiraTicket, baseWorktreeName, manager)
```

## Key Findings

1. **Branch Name Pattern**: The mergeback branch names follow the pattern `merge/WORKTREE_NAME_TARGET` or `merge/JIRA-TICKET_TARGET` (e.g., `merge/fix-auth_preview`, `merge/PROJECT-123_main`)

2. **Worktree Name Pattern**: The mergeback worktree names follow the pattern `MERGE_WORKTREE_TARGET` (e.g., `MERGE_fix-auth_preview`, `MERGE_PROJECT-123_main`)

3. **Unified Logic**: The code uses a unified branch name generator (`createBranchNameGenerator`) that's shared between hotfix and mergeback commands, with different prefixes ("hotfix" vs "merge")

4. **Configurable Prefix**: The "MERGE_" prefix for worktree names is configurable via the `mergeback_prefix` setting in the config file, defaulting to "MERGE"

5. **Target Suffix**: The branch names include a target suffix (like "_preview", "_main") to prevent conflicts when merging to different branches

The most recent commit (5e0c3e8) unified the branch name generation logic between hotfix and mergeback commands, which explains why they share the same underlying implementation in `helpers.go`.

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I've identified the bug in the mergeback branch naming logic. Here's what I found:

## Analysis Results

### 1. How Mergeback Determines Source and Target Branches

The mergeback command flow works as follows:

1. **Auto-detection or explicit worktree name**: The command either auto-detects a worktree name from recent git activity or takes it as an argument
2. **Target branch determination**: It calls `findMergeTargetBranchAndWorktree()` which:
   - Reads the `gbm.branchconfig.yaml` file
   - Identifies which branch the current context should merge into based on the `merge_into` field
   - Returns the target branch and target worktree name

### 2. Where the Bug Occurs in the Naming Logic

The bug is in the **worktree naming logic** at **lines 84-90** in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/mergeback.go`:

```go
// Get mergeback prefix from config and build worktree name
mergebackPrefix := manager.GetConfig().Settings.MergebackPrefix
var mergebackWorktreeName string
if mergebackPrefix != "" {
    mergebackWorktreeName = mergebackPrefix + "_" + worktreeName + "_" + baseWorktreeName  // BUG: Using baseWorktreeName (target)
} else {
    mergebackWorktreeName = worktreeName + "_" + baseWorktreeName  // BUG: Using baseWorktreeName (target)
}
```

**However, the issue description seems to contradict itself**. The code is actually working correctly:

- `baseWorktreeName` comes from `findMergeTargetBranchAndWorktree()` which returns the **target** worktree name
- For a merge from production -> master, `baseWorktreeName` should be "master" (the target)
- The current code creates: `MERGE_INGSVC-5638_master` (which is what the issue says it should be)

### 3. The Real Bug Location

After careful analysis, I believe the bug is in the **branch naming logic**. Looking at the `generateMergebackBranchName` function on **line 234-237**:

```go
var generateMergebackBranchName = func(worktreeName, jiraTicket, targetWorktree string, manager *internal.Manager) (string, error) {
    generator := createBranchNameGenerator("merge")
    return generator(worktreeName, jiraTicket, strings.ToLower(targetWorktree), manager)
}
```

This calls `createBranchNameGenerator` which is in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/helpers.go`. The branch name generator uses the `targetSuffix` parameter correctly, but the issue might be in **how the target is being determined**.

### 4. Complete Flow Analysis

From the task description, the issue is:
- **Current**: `MERGE_INGSVC-5638_production` (using source "production")
- **Expected**: `MERGE_INGSVC-5638_master` (using target "master")

The problem appears to be that `findMergeTargetBranchAndWorktree()` is returning "production" instead of "master" as the target. Let me check if there's a logic error in this function.

### 5. The Configuration Issue

Looking at the `findMergeTargetBranchAndWorktree` function more carefully, it tries to:

1. Get the current branch 
2. Find it in the config and see what it merges into
3. If that fails, it falls back to `findNextBranchAndWorktreeInChain`

The issue might be in **step 3** - the fallback logic in `findNextBranchAndWorktreeInChain()` (lines 178-230) which seems to find the branch that merges INTO production, rather than what production merges into.

### Recommendation

The bug is likely in the `findMergeTargetBranchAndWorktree` function's logic for determining what the target branch should be when merging from production to master. The function is returning the source branch name instead of the target branch name in the naming convention.

To fix this, you need to:

1. **Fix the target determination logic** in `findMergeTargetBranchAndWorktree()`
2. **Add tests** that verify when merging production -> master, the names use "master" as the suffix
3. **Verify the configuration parsing** to ensure the `merge_into` relationships are being read correctly

The core issue appears to be that the function is returning the wrong branch as the "target" for naming purposes.
