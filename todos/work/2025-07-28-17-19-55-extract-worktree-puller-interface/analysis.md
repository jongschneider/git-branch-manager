# Analysis for Extract worktreePuller interface for cmd/pull.go

## Agent 1: Analyze pull.go structure

Based on my analysis of the `cmd/pull.go` file, here's a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Functions Defined in the File

The file defines **4 main functions**:

1. **`newPullCommand() *cobra.Command`** (lines 13-64)
   - Creates and configures the Cobra command for pull operations
   - Handles command-line flags and arguments
   - Sets up shell completion for worktree names
   - Routes to appropriate handler functions based on arguments

2. **`handlePullAll(manager *internal.Manager) error`** (lines 66-69)
   - Handles the `--all` flag case to pull all worktrees
   - Simple wrapper that calls the Manager method

3. **`handlePullCurrent(manager *internal.Manager, currentPath string) error`** (lines 71-84)
   - Handles pulling the current worktree when no specific name is provided
   - Validates that the user is currently in a worktree
   - Uses current working directory to determine which worktree to pull

4. **`handlePullNamed(manager *internal.Manager, worktreeName string) error`** (lines 86-99)
   - Handles pulling a specifically named worktree
   - Validates that the worktree exists before attempting to pull

### 2. Manager Methods Being Called

The pull command uses **4 key Manager methods**:

1. **`manager.PullAllWorktrees() error`** (line 68)
   - Pulls all available worktrees
   - Used by `handlePullAll`

2. **`manager.IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)`** (line 73)
   - Determines if the current directory is within a worktree
   - Returns whether in worktree, worktree name, and any error
   - Used by `handlePullCurrent`

3. **`manager.GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*WorktreeListInfo, error)`** (line 88)
   - Retrieves all worktrees as a map
   - Used for validation in `handlePullNamed`

4. **`manager.PullWorktree(worktreeName string) error`** (lines 83, 98)
   - Pulls a specific worktree by name
   - Used by both `handlePullCurrent` and `handlePullNamed`

### 3. Current Structure and Dependencies

**Dependencies:**
- Standard library: `errors`, `fmt`, `os`
- Internal package: `gbm/internal`
- External: `github.com/spf13/cobra`

**Helper Functions Used:**
- `createInitializedManager()` - Creates Manager instance (from `cmd/root.go`)
- `PrintInfo()` - User output formatting (from `cmd/root.go`)
- `PrintVerbose()` - Verbose output formatting (from `cmd/root.go`)
- `getWorktreeNames()` - Shell completion helper (from `cmd/switch.go`)

**Error Handling:**
- Uses `ErrLoadGBMConfig` for configuration loading failures
- Consistent error wrapping with `fmt.Errorf` and `%w` verb
- Special handling for configuration errors (logged but not fatal)

### 4. Patterns Used

**Error Handling Pattern:**
```go
if err != nil {
    if !errors.Is(err, ErrLoadGBMConfig) {
        return err
    }
    PrintVerbose("%v", err)
}
```
- Configuration errors are treated as warnings, not fatal errors
- Other errors are propagated up the call stack
- Consistent use of error wrapping

**User Interaction Pattern:**
- Uses `PrintInfo()` for user feedback before operations
- Informative error messages with context
- Validation before operations (e.g., checking if worktree exists)

**Command Structure Pattern:**
- Single entry point (`newPullCommand`) that routes to handlers
- Separate handler functions for different scenarios
- Flag-based routing (`--all` flag changes behavior)
- Shell completion integration

### 5. Interface Requirements for worktreePuller

Based on the analysis, a `worktreePuller` interface would need these methods:

```go
type worktreePuller interface {
    PullAllWorktrees() error
    PullWorktree(worktreeName string) error
    IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)
    GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*WorktreeListInfo, error)
}
```

The pull command has a clean separation of concerns with:
- Command setup and routing in `newPullCommand`
- Business logic delegated to the Manager
- Clear error handling and user feedback
- Validation before operations
- Support for multiple pull scenarios (current, named, all)

This structure would work well with interface extraction, as the pull command only depends on these 4 specific Manager methods and could easily be refactored to use a `worktreePuller` interface instead of the full Manager struct.

## Agent 2: Find Manager methods used

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here are the methods available on the Manager struct that relate to pulling worktrees:

### Primary Pull Methods

1. **`PullWorktree(worktreeName string) error`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go:642`
   - Pulls changes for a specific worktree by name
   - Constructs the worktree path and delegates to GitManager.PullWorktree()

2. **`PullAllWorktrees() error`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go:669`
   - Pulls changes for all existing worktrees
   - Gets all worktrees using GetAllWorktrees() and iterates through them
   - Continues on failure, reporting errors but not stopping the operation

### Discovery and Validation Methods

3. **`IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go:647`
   - Checks if the current path is within a worktree
   - Returns whether it's in a worktree, the worktree name, and any error
   - Delegates to GitManager.IsInWorktree()

4. **`GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*WorktreeListInfo, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go:407`
   - Returns comprehensive information about all worktrees
   - Includes both tracked (from gbm.branchconfig.yaml) and ad-hoc worktrees
   - Returns WorktreeListInfo containing path, expected branch, current branch, and git status

### Supporting Information Methods

5. **`GetWorktreeList() (map[string]*WorktreeListInfo, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go:354`
   - Returns tracked worktrees from gbm.branchconfig.yaml only
   - Similar to GetAllWorktrees() but filtered to configured worktrees

6. **`GetWorktreeStatus(worktreePath string) (*GitStatus, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go:715`
   - Gets the Git status for a specific worktree path
   - Returns GitStatus with information about dirty state, ahead/behind counts, etc.

7. **`GetWorktreePath(worktreeName string) (string, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/manager.go:397`
   - Constructs and validates the full path to a worktree by name
   - Checks if the worktree directory exists

## Supporting Types

**WorktreeListInfo struct:**
```go
type WorktreeListInfo struct {
    Path           string
    ExpectedBranch string
    CurrentBranch  string
    GitStatus      *GitStatus
}
```

**GitStatus struct:**
```go
type GitStatus struct {
    IsDirty   bool
    Ahead     int
    Behind    int
    Untracked int
    Modified  int
    Staged    int
}
```

## Underlying GitManager Methods

The Manager delegates to these GitManager methods:

1. **`PullWorktree(worktreePath string) error`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/git.go:1011`
   - Handles the actual git pull operation
   - Checks for upstream branch configuration
   - Sets upstream if needed or falls back to explicit remote/branch

2. **`GetUpstreamBranch(worktreePath string) (string, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/git.go:937`
   - Gets the upstream branch for a worktree
   - Returns empty string (not error) if no upstream is configured

3. **`GetWorktreeStatus(worktreePath string) (*GitStatus, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/git.go:777`
   - Gets comprehensive status including ahead/behind counts

4. **`GetAheadBehindCount(worktreePath string) (int, int, error)`** - `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/git.go:952`
   - Returns commits ahead and behind upstream

These methods provide comprehensive functionality for discovering, validating, and pulling worktrees, with proper error handling and status reporting.

## Agent 3: Check existing test patterns

Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the existing testing patterns in the codebase. Let me provide you with a detailed analysis of the current testing approach and patterns.

### 1. Existing Test Files

The codebase has extensive test coverage with **25 `*_test.go` files** across both `/cmd` and `/internal` directories:

**Command Tests (`/cmd`):**
- `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/add_test.go`
- `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/pull_test.go`
- `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/push_test.go`
- `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/sync_test.go`
- And 11 others for various commands

**Internal Tests (`/internal`):**
- `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/git_test.go`
- `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/mergeback_test.go`
- And 8 others for internal functionality

### 2. Interface Definitions and Mock Generation

**Current Interface Pattern:**
The codebase follows a clear interface extraction pattern, as seen in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/add.go`:

```go
//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreeAdder.go . worktreeAdder

// worktreeAdder interface abstracts the Manager operations needed for adding worktrees
type worktreeAdder interface {
    AddWorktree(worktreeName, branchName string, newBranch bool, baseBranch string) error
    GetDefaultBranch() (string, error)
    BranchExists(branch string) (bool, error)
    GetJiraIssues() ([]internal.JiraIssue, error)
    GenerateBranchFromJira(jiraKey string) (string, error)
}
```

### 3. Mock Generation Tool

**Tool Used:** `github.com/matryer/moq`
- **Pattern:** `//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_interfaceName.go . interfaceName`
- **Output:** Creates type-safe mocks with call tracking
- **Example:** `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/autogen_worktreeAdder.go`

### 4. Testing Framework and Tools

**Primary Testing Stack:**
- **Testing Framework:** `github.com/stretchr/testify`
  - `assert` for assertions
  - `require` for critical conditions
- **Mock Generation:** `github.com/matryer/moq`
- **Test Utilities:** Custom utilities in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/internal/testutils/mock_services.go`

### 5. Testing Patterns Used

**A. Table-Driven Tests with Mocks:**
```go
func TestArgsResolver_ResolveArgs(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name      string
        args      []string
        newBranch bool
        mockSetup func() *worktreeAdderMock
        expectErr func(t *testing.T, err error)
        expect    func(t *testing.T, result *WorktreeArgs)
    }{
        // Test cases...
    }
}
```

**B. Integration Tests:**
- Use real Git repositories with `testutils.GitTestRepo`
- Setup full test environments with worktrees
- Test end-to-end functionality

**C. Mock Pattern:**
```go
mockManager := &worktreeAdderMock{
    GetDefaultBranchFunc: func() (string, error) {
        return "main", nil
    },
    AddWorktreeFunc: func(worktreeName, branchName string, newBranch bool, baseBranch string) error {
        return nil
    },
}
```

### 6. Current worktreePuller Interface Requirements

Based on the pull command analysis (`/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/cmd/pull.go`), the `worktreePuller` interface would need:

```go
type worktreePuller interface {
    PullAllWorktrees() error
    IsInWorktree(currentPath string) (bool, string, error)
    PullWorktree(worktreeName string) error
    GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]interface{}, error) // Return type may vary
}
```

### 7. Planned Interface Extraction

According to the documentation in `/Users/jschneider/code/scratch/worktree-manager/docs/interface-refactoring-plan.md`, the plan includes extracting these interfaces:
- `worktreePuller` (for pull command)
- `worktreePusher` (for push command)
- `worktreeRemover` (for remove command)
- And 8 others

### 8. Test File Organization

**Two Testing Approaches:**
1. **Unit Tests:** Fast tests using mocks for business logic
2. **Integration Tests:** Slower tests using real Git operations

Comments in test files indicate this dual approach:
```go
// UNIT TESTS (Using mocks - these are fast and don't require real git operations)
// These tests use the worktreeAdder interface with mocks to test business logic
```

### Recommendations for worktreePuller Interface and Tests

Based on these patterns, when creating the `worktreePuller` interface and tests, you should:

1. **Follow the established pattern:** Define interface → Add `//go:generate` directive → Create table-driven tests
2. **Use `github.com/stretchr/testify`** for assertions
3. **Generate mocks with `moq`** using the exact pattern: `//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreePuller.go . worktreePuller`
4. **Create both unit and integration tests** following the existing dual approach
5. **Use the module name `gbm`** as seen in go.mod
6. **Follow the table-driven test structure** with `mockSetup`, `expectErr`, and `expect` functions

The codebase demonstrates mature testing practices with comprehensive coverage, clear separation between unit and integration tests, and consistent patterns across all commands.
