# Extract worktreePuller interface for cmd/pull.go
**Status:** Done
**Agent PID:** 97955

## Original Todo
**Extract worktreePuller interface for cmd/pull.go**
- Create interface with: PullAllWorktrees(), PullWorktree(), IsInWorktree(), GetAllWorktrees()
- Add mock generation: `//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreePuller.go . worktreePuller`
- Refactor command functions to use interface
- Write unit tests with mocks

## Description
We're extracting a `worktreePuller` interface from the Manager struct to enable unit testing of the pull command using mocks instead of real Git operations. The pull command currently depends on 4 specific Manager methods: `PullAllWorktrees()`, `PullWorktree()`, `IsInWorktree()`, and `GetAllWorktrees()`. By creating this interface, we can write fast, isolated unit tests that don't require Git repositories.

## Implementation Plan
- [x] **Define worktreePuller interface in cmd/pull.go** (cmd/pull.go:16-21)
  - Create interface with: PullAllWorktrees() error, PullWorktree(string) error, IsInWorktree(string) (bool, string, error), GetAllWorktrees() (map[string]*internal.WorktreeListInfo, error)
  - Add go:generate directive for mock generation: `//go:generate go tool moq -out ./autogen_worktreePuller.go . worktreePuller`
- [x] **Refactor pull command functions to use interface** (cmd/pull.go:76-108)
  - Update handlePullAll, handlePullCurrent, handlePullNamed to accept worktreePuller instead of *internal.Manager
  - Manager still implements interface, so newPullCommand passes manager directly to handlers
- [x] **Generate mocks and create unit tests** (cmd/pull_test.go:16-250)
  - Generated autogen_worktreePuller.go with moq tool
  - Added comprehensive unit tests for each handler function using mocks
  - Followed existing table-driven test pattern with mockSetup, expectErr functions
  - Tests cover success cases and all error scenarios
- [x] **Automated test: Run go test ./cmd -run TestPull to verify unit tests pass**
- [x] **User test: Verify pull command still works correctly with `gbm pull --help` shows proper usage**
- [x] **Move integration tests to internal package** (create internal/pull_test.go)
  - Removed integration tests from cmd/pull_test.go, keeping only fast unit tests with mocks
  - Created internal/pull_test.go with TODO for proper integration tests implementation
  - Integration tests need more complex setup to handle git worktree scenarios properly
- [x] **Implement proper integration tests in internal/pull_test.go** (internal/pull_test.go:1-228)
  - Replaced TODO with comprehensive integration tests following git_add_test.go pattern
  - TestManager_PullWorktree() fully passes: tests successful pulls, nonexistent worktrees, and conflicts
  - Integration tests properly handle remote changes and worktree scenarios using createRemoteChanges helper
  - Tests cover real git pull operations with fast-forward merges and conflict detection
  - TestManager_PullAllWorktrees() has minor issues but core functionality is demonstrated
- [x] **Fix failing integration tests in internal/pull_test.go** (TestManager_PullAllWorktrees failures)
  - Completely rewrote TestManager_PullAllWorktrees with proper test setup
  - All 3 test scenarios now pass: NoWorktrees, SingleWorktreeNoChanges, SingleWorktreeWithRemoteChanges
  - Fixed upstream tracking setup issue - key insight for making git pull work in worktrees
  - Tests validate both PullWorktree and PullAllWorktrees functionality comprehensively
  - Remote change pulling fully works with proper fetch and upstream configuration

## Notes
**IMPORTANT**: Still need to migrate integration tests from cmd/pull_test.go to internal/pull_test.go following the pattern established in cmd/add.go and internal/git_add_test.go. The current integration tests in cmd/pull_test.go should be moved to test the Manager.PullWorktree(), Manager.PullAllWorktrees(), etc. methods directly in the internal package, leaving only the fast unit tests with mocks in the cmd package.

This migration was identified during the commit review and should be completed as a follow-up task.
