# TODO
- [x] option to log to file
- [x] binary can be called anywhere inside the git repo
- [ ] add clone verb
    - [ ] clones a bare repo
    - [ ] creates the MAIN worktree using the HEAD branch
    - [ ] detects if the worktree has a .envrc
        * YES - use that as the .envrc for the repo
        * NO - tell user to create a .envrc file. suggest to user to generate one based on the initial worktree we created.
- [ ] support direnv
    - [ ] fetch
    - [ ] validate
    - [ ] check
    - [ ] if configuration in remote `.envrc` is different from local `.envrc`, don't auto `gbm sync`. instead, ask user if they want to sync.
- [ ] suport `add` verb to add worktree
    - [ ] normal worktree on new branch
    - [ ] normal worktree on existing branch
    - [ ] worktree based on JIRA ticket (use `jira-cli` to select ticket)
        - [ ] configure your own rules for parsing jira ticket for branch name

- [x] enhance `switch` command (future features)

- [ ] add `push` verb to simplify worktrees (avoid the whole -u nonsense)
- [ ] configuration for copying files into new worktrees (.env, anything not tracked by git)
- [x] add completion support (cobra built-in bash/zsh/fish/powershell)
